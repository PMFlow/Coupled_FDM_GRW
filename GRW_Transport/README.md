This folder contains the following Matlab scripts and data files:

#

- 'main_ensemble_coefficients.m' is a 2D  GRW algorithm for advection-diffusion in random fields using velocity realizations stored in

    '..\FDM_Flow\test_implicitFDM' and '..\FDM_Flow\test_explicitFDM'

- 'Gauss_IC.m' is the function giving a Gaussian initial condition.

- 'ensemble_coefficients_implicitFEM.mat' and
      'ensemble_coefficients_explicitFEM.mat'
      contain the resulting velocity components of the center of mass of the solute plume and the ensemble dispersion coefficients.
